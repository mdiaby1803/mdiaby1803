# Hi there, I'm Meman Diaby ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a dedicated professional with a strong academic background and diverse experience in economics, health economics, and data science. With a Master of Science in Economics from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), I am now actively engaged as a Research Analyst at the Center for Health Equity Transformation, University of Kentucky, where I collaborate on projects related to social epidemiology and racial health equity.

Previously, I served as a Research Assistant, leading reproductive health surveys for non-Hispanic Black immigrant women and screening patients for research eligibility. My proficiency in data analysis and visualization, along with expertise in statistical software such as Stata, R, Python, SAS, and SQL, has been instrumental in evaluating economic conditions and preparing reports on various economic indicators.

As an Adjunct Faculty member at Ivy Tech Community College Indianapolis, I teach Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, effectively integrating technology and policy considerations into my lessons to engage students.

With certifications in data management, economic modeling, and forecasting, I am well-prepared to excel in roles focused on research, data analysis, health economics, economics, and financial analysis. I am passionate about contributing to meaningful research and leveraging my skills to make a positive impact in the field of health equity and economics.
