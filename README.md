# Hi there, I'm Meman Diaby ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a Research Analyst at the University of Kentucky, College of Medicine, specializing in social epidemiology, behavioral and mental health, and substance use research. In my role, I conduct comprehensive literature reviews, manage and analyze large epidemiological datasets using SAS, Stata, and R, and prepare data visualizations and reports to support presentations, publications, and grant applications. My work involves collaboration on projects focused on racial health equity, social determinants of health, psychiatric comorbidities, and structural racism, with a specific emphasis on health disparities in tobacco and cannabis regulation.

With a Master of Science in Economics from Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), I bring a strong foundation in data science and health economics, further enriched by previous roles as a Research Assistant and Adjunct Faculty member. I continue to deepen my skills through evening Data Science classes and conference participation, exploring intersections of substance misuse, discrimination, and sociodemographics. Recent projects include sophisticated variable cleaning, recoding, and visualization to uncover insights into cannabis use, sociodemographic trends, and discrimination indices.

Certified in data management, economic modeling, and forecasting, I am well-equipped for roles that demand rigorous analysis and impactful research. Passionate about advancing health and equity research, I am eager to leverage my skills to drive positive outcomes in health, economics, and social epidemiology.
