# Hi there, I'm Meman Diaby ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a dedicated professional with a strong academic background and diverse experience in economics, health economics, and data science. With a Master of Science in Economics at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), I am actively engaged as a Research Assistant, leading reproductive health surveys for non-Hispanic Black immigrant women and screening patients for research eligibility. My proficiency in data analysis and visualization, along with expertise in statistical software such as Stata, R, and SQL has been instrumental in evaluating economic conditions and preparing authoritative reports on different economic indicators. Additionally, as an Adjunct Faculty member at Ivy Tech Community College Indianapolis, I effectively teach Microeconomics, integrating technology and policy considerations into my lessons to engage students actively. With certifications in data management, economic modeling, and forecasting, I am prepared to excel in roles focused on research, data analysis, health economics, economics, and financial analysis. Passionate about contributing to meaningful research in Economics, I am eager to leverage my skills and expertise to make a positive impact in this field.
